## MIT Coursework

My completed coursework for 9 MIT courses taken through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) and [MIT Open Learning Library](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/). Each repository covers the exact same coursework required of MIT students for full marks. All solutions are my own.

\*Practice exams were not graded at the time of completion (~2021). To be more precise, they were graded in 2026 using Claude Opus 4.6 with extended thinking enabled, cross-referenced with the official solutions.

\*\*\*Quiz 1 scores were low across the board in the original Fall 2011 MIT class this course was recorded from. The course staff acknowledged this [here](https://youtu.be/a_otxyu0mSQ?si=FOkm1kT4oVYHMaTe&t=34): *"The results are lower than what we thought... the mistake was on our part."*

## Projects

[Hologram-Engine](https://github.com/BenyaminJazayeri/Hologram-Engine) — A 3D graphics engine with real-life spatial display using 2D screens and eye tracking. A childhood project built between the ages of 14 and 17 (2016-2019), inspired by Iron Man's holographic table.
